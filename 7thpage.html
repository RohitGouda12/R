        <h2>About Mango Tree</h2>
        <p>
            A mango tree is a large, evergreen tree of the cashew family, native to South Asia, that is grown for its fruit. It can reach heights of up to 100 feet, has a thick trunk, and a dense, rounded canopy of glossy, dark green leaves that are reddish-pink when young. The tree produces clusters of fragrant, creamy-pink flowers and the fruit is a stone fruit with sweet, orange-yellow flesh.

           Care of Mango tree
        </h3>
        <p> Sunlight: Mango trees need at least 6–8 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal fruit production. <br><br>Soil: Plant in well-draining, loamy soil that is slightly acidic to slightly alkaline (pH 5.5-7.5). Improve drainage by mixing in compost or other organic matter. <br><br>Protection: Protect young trees from strong winds by staking them. <br><br><h3>
        Watering</h3>
Young trees: Water young trees frequently to help them establish their root systems. You can start with watering every other day and gradually increase to once or twice a week. <br><br>Established trees: Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the top few inches of soil to dry out before watering again. <br><br>Before flowering: Withhold irrigation for about two months before flowering and resume once fruits begin to form. <br><br>Container-grown trees: A moisture meter can help determine when to water. 
<br><br><h3>Fertilization and mulching Fertilization</h3>
Fertilizer: Use a slow-release, balanced fertilizer sparingly, following the product's instructions. A good time to fertilize is during key growth periods. <br><br>Mulch: Apply a layer of organic mulch around the base of the tree to retain moisture, but keep it a few inches away from the trunk. </p>
