           Care of areca nut
        </h3>
        <p>Climate: Cashews thrive in tropical coastal regions with moderate rainfall and temperatures between 20°C and 35°C.<br><br>
        Planting: Young saplings are transplanted to orchards after 12-18 months. They need abundant sunlight and well-drained, slightly acidic soil.<br><br>
            Harvest & Processing: Cashew apples are picked, the nuts detached and sun-dried. The nuts have a toxic, caustic resin (cashew nut shell liquid - CNSL) between two shells, so they must be roasted or steamed to remove the liquid and make shelling safe and feasible. The kernels are then peeled, graded, and packed, often using inert gas like carbon dioxide to prevent infestation.<br><br> 
            Climate & Soil: Prefers a warm, humid climate with filtered sunlight or full sun exposure. It needs deep, well-draining, loamy soil.<br><br>
            Watering: Requires regular irrigation and cannot withstand drought.<br><br>
            Maintenance: Pruning is done in the early stages, and the plant has good resistance to pests if cared for properly.
