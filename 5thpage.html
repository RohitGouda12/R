           Care of cardamom
        </h3>
        <p> Watering
Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged.
Water deeply until water drains from the bottom holes.
Allow the top inch of soil to dry out before watering again.
Mist the plant regularly to increase humidity. <br><br>
Light and temperature Place the plant in partial shade or a location with filtered, indirect sunlight.Protect it from direct, hot sunlight.Maintain temperatures between 60-80 circ  15-27 circ .If temperatures dip below 60 circ 16 circ , consider growing it in a pot that can be moved indoors. <br><br>
Soil and fertilizer
Use a fertile, humus-rich soil that is slightly acidic.
Add a balanced fertilizer every 4-6 weeks during the growing season, or an organic fertilizer with high phosphorus content.
Avoid fertilizing during the rainy season, and wait until after the rain has passed.
Mulching the base with organic matter like cattle compost is beneficial. <br><br>
Pruning and pest control
Regularly trim any yellow or dead leaves to encourage healthy growth.
Watch for common pests like aphids and spider mites, and treat any infestations promptly.
If growing indoors, be particularly vigilant for pests like mealybugs during winter, as they can multiply in warm indoor environments.
