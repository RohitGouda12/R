        <h2>About </h2>
        <p>
Cloves are the aromatic, dried flower buds of the Syzygium aromaticum tree, known for their strong, pungent, and sweet flavor. They are used widely in cooking, especially in baked goods, savory dishes, and beverages, and are also valued for their high eugenol content and various health benefits, although pure clove oil can be toxic in high doses. Major producers include Indonesia, India, and Madagascar, and the spice has a long history of use in traditional medicine.
